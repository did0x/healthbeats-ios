# HealthBeats
HealthBeats gave a project task to determine the skill test that I mastered for the initial selection process.

## Instructions
To run this project you need **Xcode**, the Xcode will help you to run the application on emulator or physical device.

1. Clone this project or simply you can download it as a .zip
2. If the project is already cloned and extracted, open the Xcode and then choose **Open a project or file**
3. The dialog windows will show up, and please select the project folder you have saved 
4. Run-on the emulator or physical device as you want

## Architecture 
On this project I choosed to use MVC architecture because this project were a small project. It no need the Network Service to request an APIs. 
The data is still localed too. If I use the MVVM project, I was thinking that it will be overkill.

## Improvement
And I've been thinking to improve this project by doing some stuff like,
- **Complete Other Menus**
- **Make the App More Smoothly**
